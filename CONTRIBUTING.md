# Welcome to Ruthenium contributing guide
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/my-cloud/ruthenium/blob/dev/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, merging the PR and releasing.

## New contributor guide
To get an overview of the project, read the [README](https://github.com/my-cloud/ruthenium#readme).

## Create a new issue
If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/my-cloud/ruthenium/issues/new/choose).

## Solve an issue
Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/my-cloud/ruthenium/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using [labels](https://github.com/my-cloud/ruthenium/labels) as filters. You can also take a look at the [open milestones](https://github.com/my-cloud/ruthenium/milestones) to have an idea of the issues priorities. To follow the progress of issues, let's take a look the [projects](https://github.com/my-cloud/ruthenium/projects?query=is%3Aopen)
